# Welcome To Jonas Lennie's GitHub

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub, thanks for visiting! I have a few projects for you to look at here, which represent the typical kind of thing I work on.

I'm Jonas Lennie, a passionate Computer Science student at UCL. I prioritise producing clean and well tested code that is easy to read and maintain. I'm a fast learner and very self-motivated, with an interest in Distributed Systems and Computer Networks.

Passionate computer scientist, studying an MEng at UCL.  
Produce highest standard deliverables, notably clean, well-tested code.  
Self-motivated and fast learner, interested in networks and distributed systems.

You can get in touch with me through my email, [contact@jlennie.uk](mailto:contact@jlennie.uk), on my [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/jlennie), or by looking at [my website](jlennie.uk).

Here are the repositories you can look at:
-	[**jlennieuk**](https://github.com/JonasLennie/jlennieuk) - The source code for my personal website
-	[**distributed-systems**](https://github.com/JonasLennie/distributedSystems) - Some models I've built while learning about distributed systems
-	[**leetcode**](https://github.com/JonasLennie/leetcode) - Code from a number of Leetcode problems I've solved
- [**BedTransfer**](https://github.com/JonasLennie/bedtransfer) - A project to manage beds in hospitals
- [**algorithms**](https://github.com/JonasLennie/algorithms) - Some code related to common algorithms; linked lists, sorting algorithms and all that

### A note on Java
The primary language used in most of the code here is **Java** (and JavaScript). I do have experience with many other languages, such as Python, Haskell or C++, but work primarily in Java, and I'm only able to share a small portion of the projects I work on. The remainder are either ongoing, or are graded or assessed in some way, so a lot of my work, particularly in Python, is not public.
